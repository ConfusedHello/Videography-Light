## June 29th - @ConfusedHello
It's 2AM in the morning and ~~I'm calling you now~~ making a new Git repo! Today was some initial research to determine if the project was achievable and some other general information relating to the project. Also, happy to bring @Jayx2u onboard this time! We'll be working on this project realistically over the next two weeks to (hopefully) make a decent film light for our planned upcoming video!

**Time spent: 3hrs**
